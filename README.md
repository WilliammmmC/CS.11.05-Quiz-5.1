# CS.11.05-Quiz-5.1

1. Given two arrays of integers, write a method called combine that combines the two arrays into one larger array. The method combine will return a new one dimensional array of integers.

int[] myArray1 = {1,3,5,7,9};

int[] myArray2 = {2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16};

combine(myArray1, myArray2) → {1,3,5,7,9,2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16}

2. Given two arrays of integers of equal length, write a method called zip that zips together all elements in each array into one larger array. The method zip will return a new one dimensional array of integers. The returned array will not necessarily be sorted.

int[] myArray1 = {1,3,5,7,9};

int[] myArray2 = {2,4,6,8,10};

zip(myArray1, myArray2) → {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10}

3. Given two arrays of integers of equal length, write a method called product that multiplies each element in the first array by the element at the corresponding index in the second array. The method product will return a new one dimensional array of integers.  

int[] myArray1 = {1,3,5,7,9};

int[] myArray2 = {2,4,6,8,10};

product(myArray1, myArray2) → {2,12,30,56,90}

4. Given an array of Strings, write a method called capitalCount that calculates the number of capital letters in each String and stores them into an array. The method capitalCount will return a new one dimensional array of integers. 
There is a catch - you are required to implement two methods in order to solve this problem. One of these methods (countCapitalLetters) will be a helper method and will perform the task of counting and returning how many capital letters are in a single word. In other words, the method capitalCount will call (or use) the method countCapitalLetters in order to achieve the desired output. Hint: You can use the statement Character.isAlphabetic( … ) to determine whether a character is an alphabetic character. 

Method: capitalCount

Helper method: countCapitalLetters

Hint: 'A' = 65 and 'Z' = 90

String[] words = {“Christmas”, “IS”, “comInG”, “!”};

capitalCount(words) → {1, 2, 2, 0}
